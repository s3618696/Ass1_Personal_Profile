                    <p>
                      Like many teenagers, after graduating from high school, I
                      decided to go to RMIT to study marketing and an
                      expectation that marketing will help me to discover more
                      of my potential and will bring me a great job after
                      graduation. Unfortunately, after a year of learning in
                      marketing, I felt my self was not born for this
                      profession. I found my self very curious about everything,
                      especially the thing that high technology. My mind always
                      is bothered by one question, which is HOW IT WORK. After
                      receiving some advice from the school, I decided to change
                      my field to software engineer. In the second year at the
                      software, I started my first job as a mobile developer for
                      a Singapore company in Vietnam. My primary skill was
                      Flutter and React native. A year later, my boss wanted me
                      to try on building a web app with many combinations of
                      React JS, Redux, and Graph QL. For now, I work as a
                      front-end developer along with a project management trainy
                      position. For that, I could not spend a lot of time for
                      school, so I decided to change to IT, which an expectation
                      that IT will save me a lot of time cause my current work
                      is IT as well.

                    <h4>Why come to RMIT</h4>
                    <p>
                      I had been looking for many opportunities to go oversea
                      after high school. However, my parent did not support my
                      plan cause they did not want to be far away from me.
                      Therefore, they encourage me to go to RMIT.

                      There are various skills that I wish to learn from my
                      study in IT. Mainly, I focus on improving my code along
                      with the right product thinking. Second, my ideal position
                      is being technical project management. Hence besides the
                      increasing level of designing a web app or mobile apps. I
                      prefer to learn more about communication, UX, UI design,
                      and leadership skill.

                to work alone. My decision always based on logic and objective
                information rather than subjective emotions. Hence my teammates
                might see me as a conservative person. Therefore, to work well
                in a team, I will prefer to talk to more people and learn from
                them and feel close to them. I instead of making mentally quick
                for a decision, I prefer to listen more and get more
                information.

              Having two years of experience designing and developing mobile and

              Intelligence and include this in my ideal project called Home

              home. This app acts like a farmer who will help the users detect
              plants, giving the user the appropriate conditions needed for the
              plant, push notifications for reminding details on taking care of

              As we all know, the world is suffering from the Corona Virus.
              Growing fresh vegetables at home are met by people around the
              world during the execution of a social blockade or social dilation
              to prevent the translation of the Covid-19 disease. According to
              Quang Nam Online Newspaper, "The consumption of seeds is increased
              globally. In Russia, the demand for seed increased by 20%-30% in
              March compared to the same period last year." To support the need
              for clean vegetable farming, I came up with this idea of doing
              this project to help people in productive plants, effectively,
              through which they would increase interest in agriculture, improve
              health, and protect the environment.

                    <p style="color: black;">
                      ・Users can search for a plant or take a picture of the
                      plant they want to grow. The app will help detect the
                      plant, and output to the user plant name, plant
                      description, as well as the best environment to grow the
                      plant. <br />
                      ・After users allow the app to access their location, the
                      app will give the user advice on whether they should grow
                      the vegetable depending on the location geography and
                      weather. <br />
                      ・When users submit a growing plant, the app shows them
                      the tree planting roadmap. The roadmap needs to be as
                      detail as possible. Example: day 1 (water: 300ml, 30g
                      Na....), day 2 (temperature: 26 degree,...). <br />
                      ・The app pushes the notification to remind watering,
